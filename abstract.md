# Dynamic Web Development with Ruby and Rails

The requirements we work with change all the time. To accomodate this we
should be using tools that allow us to make changes at the same pace.
A dynamic programming language like Ruby is perfect for this, since it
allows us to alter the language to fit the business model.

Modern web applications are more integrated with other systems than ever
before. Not only do we have to integrate with the legacy business
systems, we have to integrate with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.

Rails is a wonderful example of how to use Ruby to create dynamic web
applications to fulfill the ever changing demands of modern businesses.

In this presentation, you will get an overview of Ruby and Rails and how
to use it to create modern web applications.
