.notes A priest fell into a well, but managed to grab hold of a small root an the way down. He started to scream, "Hello, is there anybody up there?". Nothing happened! He screamed again "Hello, is there anybody up there?", Suddenly a sound of thunder came from the clouds above the well. "This is your God speaking, let go of the root and I will save you!" A brief silence then the priest screamed, "Is there anybody else up there?"
